You should have all the information you need get started with your **Jekyll** and **Just the Docs*** static page on **GitHub Pages**, while possible avoiding the same mistakes I did.

**Just the Docs*** has a lot of extra options than the ones mentioned here, but this should be enough to get you started. This was all I used to make this website anyway so, have fun.

Notice that I added a few examples on the [examples repository]({{ site.data.repositories.examples.base_url }}) for the latest three subtopics of the latest page, **navigation structure**, **auxiliary links** and **side navigation order**.

When trying to deploy this to **GitHub Pages**, please remember to change the name of the project just like described [here]({{ site.data.repositories.main.github_pages.getting_started_url }}).

{% include examples-repository.markdown %}
- {{ site.data.repositories.examples.just_the_docs.customised }}
