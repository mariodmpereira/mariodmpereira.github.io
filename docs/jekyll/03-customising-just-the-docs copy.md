# {{ page.parent }} - {{ page.title }}

Before any customisation, I'm going to duplicate the directory **my-blog-just-the-docs-barebones** and name it **my-blog-just-the-docs-customised**.

## Changing to the dark theme

Yes, I'm one of those programmers.

> ### **_config.yml**
```yml
color_scheme: dark
```

Reboot your application and reload the page, you're welcome.

## Website Metadata

You can change all of the metadata about your website, I removed all of the comments because I like to keep things clean, my `_config.yml` file is as follows.
> ### **_config.yml**
```yml
color_scheme: dark
title: My Blog
email: mariodmpereira@gmail.com
description: >-
  This is my personal Developer Handbook to keep track of my learnings.
# baseurl: ""
url: "http://mariodmpereira.github.io/"
github_username:  mariodmpereira
remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
```

Please be advised that if you don't use a `baseurl` you should **remote** or **comment that line**. Trust me, it already caused me a lot of headaches trying to figure out why the website was misbehaving.

Not only you just setup some metadata for your website (like the page title), but you can now select anywhere on your markdown files one of these yaml keys using the {{ site.data.bolded.liquid }}, that comes with {{ site.data.bolded.jekyll }} out of the box.

As an example, if you want to render the title of the site you set up on `_config.yml`, all you to need to do is write this on any {{ site.data.bolded.html }} or {{ site.data.bolded.markdown }} file.

```markdown
{{ "{{ page.title " }}}}
```
## Favicon

Download any **favicon** and put it in the root folder of the project. 

Refresh, voil√†.

## Homepage title

At the time of writing this post, this theme contains a "small issue".

If you look at the screenshot above for the **favicon**, you will notice there's a hyphen before the page name. 

{{ site.data.bolded.just_the_docs }} remote theme's [`head.html`](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs/blob/main/_includes/head.html) is expecting both a `site.title` and a `page.title` for the its **HTML** `<title>` tag.

> ### **head.html**
> ```html
> <title>{{ "{{ page.title " }}}} - {{ "{{ site.title " }}}}</title>
> ```

Open your `index.markdown` on the root of the project and you will notice it only has a comment and a `layout:home` inside the {{ site.data.bolded.front_matter }} section. I removed the comment and added this line `title: Home`.

> ### **index.markdown**  
```markdown
---
layout: home
title: Home
---
```

Refresh and you should see the change.

## Side Navigation
### Hide Pages

You probably noticed that after the last step, the ``Home`` navigation appeared on the side navigation. That's because {{ site.data.bolded.just_the_docs }} searches everywhere on the project for any markdown file inside a {{ site.data.bolded.front_matter }} section for a `title`, and considers it as part of the side navigation.

If you want to hide it from the side navigation you can add this extra line `nav_exclude: true`.

> ### **index.markdown**  
```markdown
---
layout: home
title: Home
nav_exclude: true
---
```

### Add Pages

As just explained in the previous section, you can now duplicate the `index.markdown` and call it `blog.markdown`. Change it's `title` to Blog and remove the `nav_exclude: true`. This new page should now appear on the side navigation.

Tipically I store all the new pages under the `/docs` directory to keep the project structure organized, but you can leave them at the root of the project if you want. I'm going to move this `blog.markdown` I created inside `/docs/blog`

> ### **blog.markdown**  
```markdown
---
layout: home
title: Blog
---
```

### Permalinks

You can easily add the path to any page by adding `permalink: /url` to any page's {{ site.data.bolded.front_matter }}.

> ### **blog.markdown**  
```markdown
---
layout: home
title: Blog
permaling: /blog
---
```

### Navigation Structure

I think that the [Just the Docs - Navigation Structure](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/navigation-structure/) is well explained, with plenty of examples on how to make proper side navigation.

### Auxiliary Links (Top Navigation)

The same goes for this, you can check [Just the Docs - Aux links](https://just-the-docs.github.io/just-the-docs/docs/configuration/#aux-links) to simulate top navigation.

### Side Navigation Order

To order pages on the side navigation, you need to use `nav_order` on each page's {{ site.data.bolded.front_matter }}. For example, for the first page vertically you would use `nav_order: 1`, for the fourth `nav_order: 4`.

{% include examples_repository.markdown %}
- {{ site.data.devugger.examples_repository.just_the_docs_customised }}

{% include references.markdown %}

- {{ site.data.links.favicon }}
- {{ site.data.links.front_matter }}
- {{ site.data.links.just_the_docs }}
- {{ site.data.links.liquid }}
