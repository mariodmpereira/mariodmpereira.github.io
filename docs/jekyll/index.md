{{ site.data.bolded.jekyll }} is a content management system that facilitates you in building static sites.

It is awesome once you get the hang of it, but I found it a bit cumbersome to get started with. I'm gonna use their {{ site.data.links.jekyll_docs }} as a reference to help you quickstart a {{ site.data.bolded.jekyll }} project.

The purpose of teaching you about {{ site.data.bolded.jekyll }} is for you to take advantage of {{ site.data.bolded.github_pages }} free hosting for static websites, so if you haven't checked it yet, check {{ site.data.repositories.main.github_pages.home }} first.
