# GitHub Pages + Jekyll + Just the Docs

Hi there.

I have to confess that I struggled for a few days before deciding what to use to create this website.

I've tested a few options, such as {{ site.data.links.jekyll }}, [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/), [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/), [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) and [Docz](https://www.docz.site/). I also considered using either [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), but I wanted something that served [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) out of the box.

After a lot of trial an error, I opted for {{ site.data.links.jekyll }} with the {{ site.data.links.just_the_docs }} theme.

It was a rough start because it was my first time using {{ site.data.bolded.jekyll }}, and I'm still getting used to it until today, but I'm starting to get the hang of it.

Since I don't want you to go through the same struggle I did, and in case you decided with the same tools I used, I created a detailed guide on how to serve a static website, just like this, with the tools mentioned above.

This is hosted on {{ site.data.links.github_pages }}, which is completely free.

Hope it helps, cheers from Portugal.

MÃ¡rio
