My name is [{{site.author.name}}]({{site.author.linkedin}}) and I am a Portuguese [Software Engineer]({{site.author.github}}) living in Lisbon.

This is **Devugger**, a blog where I document things I learn in this career.

As a former [Motion Graphics Designer]({{site.author.vimeo}}), I used **Adobe After Effects** as my main work tool. At some point in time, I wanted to automate things I was often repeating, so I started using Expression Language, a feature that allows the user to write scripts inside of the software itself.

As **Adobe** described on their website:

> _The **After Effects** expression language is based on **JavaScript**, with an extended set of built-in objects. **After Effects** uses the core standard **JavaScript** language, not the web browser–specific extensions._

I started learning both **JavaScript** and Expression Language, and I found myself obsessing specifically over **JavaScript**. I was investing more time in studying it than actually studying anything related to my role at the time.

Fast forward a few years from then, I decided I'd had enough of **Motion Graphics**, and decided to invest in a [Coding Bootcamp](https://www.academiadecodigo.org/) here in Lisbon, and change my career for good.

I can now proudly say that I've been working as a **Software Engineer** since early 2020, and as my career progresses, I find that there's so much stuff to learn, that it's impossible to remember everything. We google things we don't know or don't remember daily.

I will be documenting here my learning in the hope that it serves me as a reference in the future, but I hope it helps you down the road as well.

Every time I post or update any documentation I will make a new [blog post]({{ site.data.repositories.main.blog_url }}) with the publishing date, so that any change to the content is documented.

I encourage you to submit any [issue](https://github.com/mariodmpereira/mariodmpereira.github.io/issues/) or [pull request](https://github.com/mariodmpereira/mariodmpereira.github.io/pulls/) on my {{ site.data.repositories.main.github_repository }} if you feel that something is not accurate or that it could be improved. If such changes are implemented, you will be added as a contributor to said page.

All of the code examples given here are hosted on [another repository]({{ site.data.repositories.examples.base_url }}) in case you want to verify them.

Last but not least, you can check my projects at [GitHub]({{ site.author.github }}) and you can contact me through [Linkedin]({{ site.author.linkedin }}).

If you read so far, well, thank you!

Cheers from the always sunny Lisbon.

Super Mário
