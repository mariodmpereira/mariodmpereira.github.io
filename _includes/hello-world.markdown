# Hello World 
```javascript
console.log("Hello World");
```

My name is [{{site.data.author.name}}]({{site.data.author.linkedin}}), I'm a Portuguese [Software Engineer]({{site.data.author.github}}) living in Lisbon, and this is my personal documentation page, **Devugger**, short for Development Debugger.

As a former [Motion Graphics Designer]({{site.data.author.vimeo}}), I used Adobe After Effects for most of my previous career. As my career progressed, I found the need to start automating things, and I found that After Effects has a feature called Expression Language, that allows the user to write scripts to automate tasks.

As Adobe described on their website:

> *The After Effects expression language is based on {{ site.data.bolded.javascript }}, with an extended set of built-in objects. After Effects uses the core standard {{ site.data.bolded.javascript }} language, not the web browser–specific extensions.*

I started learning both {{ site.data.bolded.javascript }} and Expression Language, and I found myself obsessing over {{ site.data.bolded.javascript }}. I was investing more time in studying it than actually studying anything related to my previous role at the time.

Fast forward a few years from then, and here I am. I decided I'd had enough of **Motion Graphics**, and decided to invest in a [Coding Bootcamp](https://www.academiadecodigo.org/) here in Lisbon, and change my career for good.

I can now proudly say that I've been working as a **Software Engineer** since early 2020.

As my career progresses I found that there's so much stuff to learn, that it's impossible to remember everything. If you came here probably know, that we google things we don't know or don't remember daily.

I will be documenting here my learning in the hope that it serves me as a reference in the future, but I hope it helps you down the road as well.

Every time I post or update any documentation I will make a new [blog post]({{ site.data.devugger.links.blog_url }}) with the publishing date.

I encourage you to submit any [issue](https://github.com/mariodmpereira/mariodmpereira.github.io/issues/) or [pull request](https://github.com/mariodmpereira/mariodmpereira.github.io/pulls/) on my [GitHub repository]({{ site.data.devugger.links.repository }}) if you feel that something is not accurate or that it could be improved. If such changes are implemented you will be added as a contributor to said page.

Last but not least, all of the code examples given here are hosted on [another repository](https://github.com/mariodmpereira/devugger-examples/).

If you read so far, well, thank you! In case you want to reach me directly, you can send me an [email](mailto:{{site.data.author.email}}).

Cheers from the always sunny Lisbon.

Mário
